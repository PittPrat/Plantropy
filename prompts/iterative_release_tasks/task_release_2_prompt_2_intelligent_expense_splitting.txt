#### **Prompt 2.2: Intelligent Expense Splitting**
```
You are a backend developer with experience in financial tech.

TASK: Implement intelligent expense splitting with basic context awareness.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Users can log expenses with amount, description, and who paid.
- AI suggests how to split the expense based on description and participants.
  - e.g., "Dinner for everyone" -> split evenly.
  - e.g., "Sarah's souvenirs" -> assign to Sarah.
- Manual override for splitting logic.
- Basic tracking of who owes whom within the group.

USER INPUT EXAMPLES:
1. "$50 for dinner - paid by me"
2. "$20 for museum tickets for John and Jane - paid by Alex"
3. "Uber to airport - just me and Sarah"
4. "Hotel room for everyone for 3 nights"

AI PROCESSING:
- Extract key info: amount, payer, category, participants.
- Suggest appropriate splitting logic.
- Learn group patterns over time (future release, but design for it).
- Handle edge cases and ambiguity.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Receipt scanning with OCR (Google Vision API or similar, consider free tier limits) - (Optional for this release, manual input is primary).
- Natural language processing for expense description (LLM or simpler regex/keyword matching for this release).
- Rule-based splitting with AI enhancement.
- Real-time balance updates for all members (Supabase Realtime).

UI CONSIDERATIONS:
- Simple form for logging expenses.
- Clear display of suggested split and final split.
- Easy way to see balances.

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional expense logging and splitting feature.
- AI provides reasonable default splits for common scenarios.
- Balances are tracked accurately.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- AI suggestions for splits are accepted >70% of the time for common cases.
- Users can log and split an expense in <60 seconds.
- Balances are consistently accurate.
