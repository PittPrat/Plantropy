#### **Prompt 4.2: Dynamic Itinerary Adjustments**
```
You are an AI agent developer working on autonomous problem-solving.

TASK: Enable the AI to suggest itinerary adjustments in response to real-time disruptions (e.g., flight delays).

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- When a disruption is detected (e.g., flight delay from Prompt 4.1), AI analyzes its impact on the current itinerary.
- AI suggests changes to affected itinerary items (e.g., rebook dinner reservation, suggest alternative activity).
- Suggestions should be timely and context-aware.
- Users can accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions.

AI LOGIC:
- Identify dependencies in the itinerary (e.g., dinner reservation depends on flight arrival).
- Assess severity of disruption and its cascading effects.
- Generate alternative solutions considering group preferences and constraints.
- Prioritize solutions that minimize negative impact on the trip.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Event-driven architecture: Flight delay event triggers itinerary adjustment logic.
- Itinerary data structure must support dependencies and easy modification.
- Integration with suggestion and voting systems from previous releases.

DISRUPTION SCENARIOS:
1. Flight delayed 2 hours → affects dinner reservation.
2. Weather forecast shows rain → outdoor activities at risk (manual trigger for weather for now).
3. Museum closed unexpectedly → alternative needed (manual trigger for now).

DELIVERABLES:
- AI can identify itinerary items affected by flight delays.
- AI proposes sensible adjustments to the itinerary.
- Users can interact with these suggestions.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 80% of disruption solutions proposed by AI are considered helpful/relevant by users.
- AI responds to a disruption event with suggestions in <60 seconds.
- User stress reduction measurable through surveys (long-term goal).
