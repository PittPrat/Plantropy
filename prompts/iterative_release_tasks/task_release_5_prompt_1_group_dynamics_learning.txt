#### **Prompt 5.1: Group Dynamics Learning**
```
You are a data scientist specializing in behavioral analytics and machine learning.

TASK: Implement AI capabilities to learn group dynamics and decision-making patterns across multiple trips.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- AI analyzes past decisions, discussions, and feedback to understand how a specific group operates.
- Identifies roles (e.g., "the planner", "the budget-conscious one", "the adventurous one").
- Learns common points of contention and successful compromise strategies for that group.
- This learning should inform future recommendations and conflict resolution strategies for the group.

DATA COLLECTION:
- Booking choices and rejections.
- Conversation sentiment and topics (requires careful privacy consideration and user consent).
- Time-to-decision patterns.
- Satisfaction feedback on past choices.

PATTERN RECOGNITION:
- "Sarah usually convinces group to upgrade if X, Y, Z conditions are met."
- "Mike suggests budget options but goes along with consensus if the activity is Y."
- "Group always overspends on food, underspends on activities when visiting Z type of destination."
- "Jenny's accessibility needs require calling venues directly, which often gets forgotten."

ML APPROACHES:
- Supervised learning from labeled past decisions (if data can be labeled).
- Reinforcement learning where AI gets feedback on its suggestions/interventions.
- Clustering to identify group archetypes (advanced).
- Privacy-preserving techniques are paramount if analyzing chat data.

DELIVERABLES:
- A system that can store and process historical group data (anonymized/aggregated where possible).
- AI can generate at least one insight about a test group's dynamics after 2-3 simulated trips.
- This insight is demonstrably used to tailor a future suggestion (even if a simple rule for now).

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Recommendation accuracy improves 25% for repeat users/groups (measured by acceptance rate).
- Time to decision decreases 40% for experienced groups using the app for the 3rd+ time.
- Users report that the AI "gets them" better over time.
