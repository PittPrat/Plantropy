### **Release 3 Prompts: Conflict Resolution**

#### **Prompt 3.1: Multi-Party Preference Optimization**
```
You are an AI specialist focused on constraint satisfaction and optimization.

TASK: Implement AI-driven optimization for multi-party preferences, starting with accommodations.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Takes collected preferences (budget, style, amenities) from multiple users.
- Searches available accommodations (e.g., via API or scraped data - consider free/demo APIs).
- Recommends 1-3 options that best satisfy the group's collective preferences.
- Handles conflicting preferences by finding compromises or highlighting trade-offs.

AI APPROACH:
- Define a scoring function for accommodations based on preferences.
- Use techniques like weighted scoring, constraint satisfaction, or simple multi-objective optimization.
- Start with rule-based logic and gradually introduce ML if needed.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- LangChain or similar agent framework (optional, can start simpler).
- Vector embeddings for preference matching (optional, can start simpler).
- Constraint satisfaction algorithms.
- Reasoning chain tracking for transparency (see next prompt).

GROUP DYNAMICS HANDLING:
- Identify preference conflicts early.
- Generate compromise solutions.
- Weight preferences by importance/flexibility (if users provide this).
- Account for group hierarchy and relationships (advanced, for later).

EXAMPLE SCENARIOS:
- Sarah wants luxury ($300/night), Mike has $150 budget.
- Group needs 3 rooms, but most affordable options are 2-bedroom suites.
- Everyone wants a pool, but only expensive hotels have one.

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional accommodation suggestion feature based on group preferences.
- AI can propose compromise solutions for conflicting preferences.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- AI recommendations accepted 60%+ of the time (user feedback).
- Groups complete accommodation decisions 80% faster (user feedback).
- User satisfaction with recommendations >4/5 (survey).
