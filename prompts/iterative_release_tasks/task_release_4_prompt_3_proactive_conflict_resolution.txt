#### **Prompt 4.3: Proactive Conflict Detection & Resolution (Agent)**
```
You are an AI ethicist and system designer building trustworthy AI agents.

TASK: Develop the AI agent's capability to proactively detect potential conflicts and assist in their resolution.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- AI monitors group discussions (chat) and itinerary plans for potential conflicts (e.g., scheduling clashes, budget disagreements, preference mismatches).
- When a conflict is detected, AI can:
  - Privately notify involved parties or a designated group admin.
  - Suggest neutral ways to phrase concerns.
  - Propose compromise solutions based on collected preferences and past decisions.
- AI intervention should be subtle and helpful, not intrusive.

AI LOGIC:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) on chat data to identify sentiment, keywords indicating disagreement, or conflicting statements.
- Cross-reference itinerary items with user preferences and constraints.
- Rule-based conflict detection initially, with potential for ML-based detection later.

EXAMPLE CONFLICTS:
- Two activities scheduled at the same time.
- Proposed restaurant exceeds someone's stated budget.
- Chat discussion shows disagreement about a planned activity.

AGENT BEHAVIOR:
- Default to less intrusive actions (e.g., private notification).
- Offer assistance, don't impose solutions.
- Learn from which interventions are successful or ignored.
- Escalation to group for major decisions.
- Proactive communication with affected parties.

DELIVERABLES:
- AI can detect basic scheduling conflicts in the itinerary.
- AI can identify simple budget conflicts based on preferences.
- AI can send a private notification or a gentle public suggestion for detected conflicts.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- AI correctly identifies >70% of predefined test case conflicts.
- User feedback indicates AI interventions are helpful and not annoying.
- Reduction in manually resolved conflicts in test groups.
