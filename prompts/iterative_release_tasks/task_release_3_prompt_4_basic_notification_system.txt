#### **Prompt 3.4: Basic Notification System**
```
You are a backend developer experienced with real-time event handling.

TASK: Implement a basic notification system for key events within the app.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Notify users of: New messages in chat, new votes started, vote results, important trip updates (manually triggered for now).
- In-app notifications (e.g., a toast or a badge).
- Email notifications for critical alerts (e.g., trip cancelled - manually triggered).

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Supabase functions for triggering email notifications (e.g., via Resend, SendGrid free tiers).
- In-app notification mechanism (can be simple UI elements updated via Supabase Realtime or polling).
- User settings to manage basic notification preferences (e.g., enable/disable email notifications - very basic for this release).

UI CONSIDERATIONS:
- Unobtrusive in-app notifications.
- Clear and concise email content.

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional in-app notifications for chat and voting events.
- Basic email notification capability for critical alerts.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Notifications are delivered reliably (>99% success rate for in-app).
- Users are aware of important events without being overwhelmed.
- Email notifications are correctly formatted and sent.
