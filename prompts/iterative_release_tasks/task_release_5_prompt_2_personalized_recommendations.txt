#### **Prompt 5.2: Personalized Recommendations**
```
You are an AI engineer building recommendation systems.

TASK: Enhance AI recommendations to be personalized based on individual and group travel history.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- AI considers past liked/disliked activities, accommodations, and destinations.
- Suggestions are tailored to individual user preferences that have been explicitly stated or implicitly learned.
- For group recommendations, AI balances learned individual preferences with learned group dynamics.

PERSONALIZATION FACTORS:
- Past ratings or feedback on activities/hotels.
- Implicit preferences (e.g., user always clicks on budget options, user frequently searches for specific cuisines).
- Trip history (e.g., user has been to Paris, suggest new neighborhoods or activities).
- Cross-references with similar users/groups (collaborative filtering, if feasible and privacy-preserving).

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- User profile for storing learned preferences and interaction history.
- Recommendation algorithms that incorporate historical data (e.g., content-based filtering, simple collaborative filtering).
- Ability to explain *why* a recommendation is personalized (e.g., "Because you liked [X similar activity] on your last trip").

DELIVERABLES:
- AI activity and accommodation suggestions now incorporate user/group history.
- System can provide a basic explanation for personalization.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Click-through rate on personalized recommendations is 30% higher than generic recommendations.
- Users rate personalized suggestions as more relevant (survey).
- User retention rate >70% for users planning a second trip.
