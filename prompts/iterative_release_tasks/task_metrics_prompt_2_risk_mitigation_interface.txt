#### **Prompt 7.2: Risk Mitigation Interface**
```
You are a project manager and frontend developer focused on proactive problem-solving.

TASK: Design and implement a simple internal interface to list, track, and update status on key project risks and their mitigation strategies (as outlined in Pantropy_iterative.txt).

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Display a list of identified project risks (e.g., LLM API costs, data privacy concerns, integration failures, low user adoption).
- For each risk, show: Description, Likelihood (High/Med/Low), Impact (High/Med/Low), Mitigation Strategy, Status (Open/In Progress/Mitigated/Closed), Owner (optional).
- Allow manual updating of risk status and notes on mitigation progress.
- This interface helps keep risks visible and ensures mitigation plans are actively managed.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Data structure for storing risk information (can be a simple JSON file or Supabase table).
- UI for displaying and editing risk data (can be another section of the admin-only dashboard).

RISKS TO TRACK (examples from Pantropy_iterative.txt, to be pre-populated):
- Technical Debt from Rapid Prototyping
- LLM API Costs & Reliability
- Third-Party API Integration Failures
- Data Privacy & Security Breaches
- Scalability Issues with Supabase
- Low User Adoption / Engagement
- Inaccurate AI Suggestions / Biases
- Scope Creep

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional internal interface for tracking project risks.
- Pre-populated with key risks from the iterative plan.
- Ability to update risk status and mitigation notes.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- All major identified risks are tracked in the interface.
- Mitigation progress is clearly visible.
- The interface serves as an effective tool for risk management discussions.
