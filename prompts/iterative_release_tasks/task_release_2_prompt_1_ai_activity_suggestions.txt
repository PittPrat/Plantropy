#### **Prompt 2.1: AI Activity Suggestions**
```
You are an AI engineer focused on practical applications of LLMs.

TASK: Implement AI-powered activity suggestions based on trip location and basic user interests.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- User inputs trip destination (city/region).
- AI suggests 3-5 relevant activities (sightseeing, dining, entertainment).
- Suggestions should include a brief description, estimated cost (if applicable), and a link to more info.
- Basic interest filtering (e.g., "outdoors", "museums", "foodie").

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Integrate with a free/low-cost LLM API (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, Gemini Flash, or a self-hosted model if feasible within free tiers).
- Prompt engineering to get structured, relevant suggestions.
- Caching of suggestions to reduce API calls and costs.
- Fallback to simple keyword search if AI fails.

UI CONSIDERATIONS:
- Clear way to trigger suggestions.
- Attractive display of suggested activities.
- Easy way to save or dismiss suggestions.

API INTEGRATIONS:
- Google Places API for venue data (if needed to supplement LLM).
- Yelp API for restaurant recommendations (if needed to supplement LLM).
- Weather API for activity planning context (optional for this release).
- Local event APIs where available (optional for this release).

PROMPT ENGINEERING:
Design prompts that:
- Specify desired output format (e.g., JSON).
- Constrain suggestions to the given location.
- Incorporate user interests effectively.
- Encourage concise and actionable descriptions.

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional AI activity suggestion feature.
- Suggestions are relevant to the location and basic interests.
- Caching mechanism is in place.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 70% of users find AI suggestions helpful (survey/feedback).
- AI suggestions clicked/saved 40% of the time.
- Average cost per 100 suggestions < $1 (monitor API usage).
