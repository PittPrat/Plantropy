#### **Prompt 3.2: Transparent AI Reasoning**
```
You are a UX designer specializing in AI ethics and explainability.

TASK: Design and implement a system that clearly explains *why* the AI made a particular recommendation (especially for accommodation).

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- For each AI recommendation, provide a simple explanation of how it meets (or doesn't meet) group preferences.
- Highlight trade-offs made (e.g., "This option is slightly over budget for Mike, but meets everyone's desire for a pool").
- Avoid overly technical jargon; use plain language.
- Complex reasoning needs simple visualization.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- Step-by-step reasoning display (if applicable).
- Interactive exploration of alternatives (e.g., "Show me options that prioritize Mike's budget").
- Confidence scores for recommendations (optional).
- "What if" scenarios for user exploration (advanced, for later).

VISUAL DESIGN PATTERNS:
- Reasoning timeline with decision points.
- Trade-off visualization (e.g., spider chart of satisfaction vs. cost vs. amenities).
- Interactive elements to explore alternatives.
- Clear language avoiding technical jargon.

EXAMPLE EXPLANATIONS:
- "Option A: Best overall match. Meets 4/5 preferences for Sarah, 3/5 for Mike, 5/5 for Jane. Slightly exceeds Mike's budget by $20/night but includes free breakfast for all, potentially offsetting the cost."
- "Option B: Best budget choice. Fits everyone's budget but lacks a pool, which was a high priority for Jane."

DELIVERABLES:
- UI component that displays AI reasoning alongside recommendations.
- Explanations are clear, concise, and helpful.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Users report understanding why AI made its suggestions >80% of the time.
- Transparency increases trust in AI recommendations (measured by survey).
- Zero AI hallucinations or inappropriate suggestions in reasoning text.
