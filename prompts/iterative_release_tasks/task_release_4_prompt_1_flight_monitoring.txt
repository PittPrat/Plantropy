### **Release 4 Prompts: Real-Time Coordination**

#### **Prompt 4.1: Flight Monitoring & Notifications**
```
You are a backend engineer specializing in real-time data integration.

TASK: Implement flight status monitoring with automated notifications for delays and cancellations.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- Users can input flight numbers for their trips.
- System periodically checks flight status using a third-party API.
- Automatically notifies group members of significant delays, cancellations, or gate changes.

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Integrate with a flight status API (e.g., FlightStats, AeroDataBox - check free/low-cost tiers).
- Background job scheduler (e.g., cron, Supabase scheduled functions) to poll for updates.
- Robust error handling for API failures or invalid flight numbers.
- Notification system (from Release 3) to send alerts.

API POLLING STRATEGY:
- More frequent polling closer to departure time.
- Less frequent polling far in advance.
- Stop polling after flight arrival or cancellation.

NOTIFICATION TRIGGERS:
- Delay > 30 minutes.
- Flight cancellation.
- Gate change.
- Early arrival > 15 minutes.

DELIVERABLES:
- Functional flight monitoring for user-added flights.
- Automated notifications for significant flight status changes.

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 100% of flight delays >30min detected and communicated within 5 minutes of API update.
- System handles 100 concurrent flights being monitored (simulated).
- API costs remain within budget (e.g., <$5 for 1000 flights monitored).
