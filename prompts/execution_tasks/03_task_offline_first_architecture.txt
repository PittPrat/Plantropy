## Task 03: Architect Offline-First Capabilities and Intelligent Sync for Mobile

**Objective:** Design the offline-first architecture for the Plantropy mobile app, including strategies for intelligent data synchronization and conflict resolution. This also includes aspects of background intelligence related to sync.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on the technical aspects of implementing a robust offline experience. Prepare to elaborate on data storage, sync logic, and conflict handling for development planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt (relevant sections):**

```
**Travel Coordination Mobile Features:**
- Offline itinerary access with essential travel information

DELIVERABLES: (from a broader section, but relevant here)
3. Offline-first architecture with intelligent sync and conflict resolution

**Background Intelligence:**
```typescript
// Intelligent background processing for seamless user experience
class BackgroundIntelligenceManager {
  // ... (prefetching logic omitted for focus on sync)
  
  // Intelligent sync with conflict resolution
  async intelligentBackgroundSync(localData: LocalData, remoteData: RemoteData): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // Priority-based sync with critical data processing first
    // Conflict detection with user notification and resolution option preparation
    // Bandwidth optimization with compression and delta synchronization
    // Battery consideration with adaptive sync frequency and intensity
    // Error recovery with retry logic and offline queue management
  }
}
```

**Real-Time Communication System:** (relevant for offline message handling)
```typescript
// Real-time messaging with AI integration
class RealTimeCommunicationSystem {
  // ...
  // Offline message queueing with automatic resend on reconnection
  async handleOfflineMessages(userId: string, messages: Message[]): Promise<void> {
    // Secure local storage for undelivered messages
    // Timestamping and sequencing for correct ordering on delivery
    // User notification for undelivered messages after prolonged outage
    // Automatic resend with exponential backoff on network recovery
    // Sync with server to prevent message duplication or loss
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Data Consistency:** (relevant for sync and conflict resolution)
- Strong consistency for critical coordination data (plans, decisions)
- Eventual consistency for non-critical data (preferences, history)
- Conflict resolution with user intervention when necessary
- Audit trail for all coordination actions and decisions
- Backup and recovery for critical group data

```
