## Task 05: Plan Advanced Mobile AI - Visual Planning (Computer Vision / Augmented Reality)

**Objective:** Define the features and technical approach for integrating computer vision (CV) and augmented reality (AR) capabilities into the Plantropy mobile app for enhanced planning assistance.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on the `VisualPlanningAssistant` class, including menu analysis and AR navigation. Prepare to elaborate on these for development planning, considering image processing, CV algorithms, AR frameworks, and 3D rendering.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
**Computer Vision and AR Integration:**
```typescript
// Camera-based planning assistance
class VisualPlanningAssistant {
  // Restaurant menu analysis with AI recommendations
  async analyzeMenuPhoto(imageData: ImageData, groupPreferences: GroupPreferences): Promise<MenuAnalysis> {
    // OCR for text extraction from menu images
    // AI-powered dish recognition and ingredient analysis
    // Dietary restriction filtering and preference matching
    // Price range estimation and value assessment
    // User review integration for popular dish highlighting
  }
  
  // AR-enhanced environment exploration
  async exploreEnvironmentAR(location: Location, preferences: UserPreferences): Promise<ARExplorationData> {
    // Real-world object recognition for landmark identification
    // Points of interest (POI) overlay with relevant information
    // Interactive AR elements for discovering hidden gems
    // Cultural context provision with historical and social significance
    // Integration with existing itinerary for seamless experience enhancement
  }
  
  // AR-powered navigation and discovery
  async provideARNavigation(destination: Location, preferences: UserPreferences): Promise<ARNavigationData> {
    // Augmented reality overlay with directional guidance and POI highlighting
    // Real-time translation of signs and menus with cultural context
    // Hidden gem discovery with local insider recommendations
    // Safety assessment with real-time crime and traffic data integration
    // Social integration with friend check-ins and recommendation sharing
  }
}
```
