## Task 08: Define Mobile Quality Assurance (QA) Strategy

**Objective:** Establish a comprehensive quality assurance strategy for the Plantropy mobile application, covering testing methodologies and performance monitoring.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on the types of testing to be performed (unit, integration, performance, device, accessibility) and the tools/metrics for performance monitoring. Prepare to elaborate on these for QA planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR MOBILE:

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit testing with Jest and React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Integration testing with Detox for end-to-end user journey validation
- Performance testing with Flipper for memory and network optimization
- Device testing across multiple iOS and Android devices and OS versions
- Accessibility testing with screen readers and assistive technology validation

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Crash reporting with Sentry for real-time error tracking and resolution
- Performance monitoring with Firebase Performance for app speed and responsiveness
- Analytics integration with Firebase Analytics for user behavior tracking
- Battery usage monitoring with native tools for optimization validation
- Network usage tracking for data efficiency and cost optimization

DELIVERABLES: (from a broader section, but relevant here)
8. Quality assurance system with automated testing and performance monitoring

SUCCESS METRICS: (relevant for QA goals)
- Mobile performance parity with native app benchmarks

```
