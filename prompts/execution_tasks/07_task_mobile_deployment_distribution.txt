## Task 07: Plan Mobile App Deployment and Distribution Strategy

**Objective:** Define the strategy for deploying and distributing the Plantropy mobile application to app stores and potentially through alternative channels.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on App Store Optimization (ASO), build and release pipeline automation, and alternative distribution methods. Prepare to elaborate on these for development and release planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
DEPLOYMENT AND DISTRIBUTION:

**App Store Optimization:**
```
App Store Strategy:
├── iOS App Store
│   ├── App Store Connect setup with developer account and certificates
│   ├── App metadata optimization with keywords and screenshots
│   ├── App Review Guidelines compliance with content and functionality
│   ├── Privacy policy and data handling transparency
│   └── TestFlight beta testing with user feedback integration
├── Google Play Store
│   ├── Google Play Console setup with signing keys and release management
│   ├── Play Store listing optimization with visual assets and descriptions
│   ├── Google Play policies compliance with content and technical requirements
│   ├── Data safety section completion with privacy practice disclosure
│   └── Internal testing track with gradual rollout strategy
├── Alternative Distribution
│   ├── Expo Application Services (EAS) for managed workflow deployment
│   ├── Direct APK distribution for Android beta testing
│   ├── Enterprise distribution for corporate demo and testing
│   └── Progressive Web App as fallback for app store approval delays
```

**Build and Release Pipeline:**
- Automated building with EAS Build for both iOS and Android platforms
- Code signing management with secure certificate and key storage
- Version management with semantic versioning and release notes
- Automated testing integration with unit, integration, and E2E test execution
- Staged deployment with internal testing, beta, and production releases

DELIVERABLES: (from a broader section, but relevant here)
6. App store deployment with iOS App Store and Google Play Store compliance

SUCCESS METRICS: (relevant for deployment goals)
- App store approval rate 100% on first submission

```
