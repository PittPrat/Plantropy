## Task 09: Implement Mobile Security and Privacy Framework

**Objective:** Define and plan the implementation of security measures and privacy compliance for the Plantropy mobile application.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on mobile-specific security implementations (certificate pinning, secure storage, RASP, code obfuscation) and privacy compliance (iOS Privacy Labels, Android Data Safety, GDPR, CCPA, COPPA). Prepare to elaborate on these for development and compliance planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
SECURITY AND PRIVACY:

**Mobile Security Implementation:**
- Certificate pinning for API communication security
- Secure storage for sensitive data with biometric protection
- Runtime application self-protection (RASP) for tampering detection
- Code obfuscation for intellectual property protection
- Regular security auditing with penetration testing and vulnerability assessment

**Privacy Compliance:**
- iOS Privacy Labels with accurate data collection disclosure
- Android Data Safety with transparent privacy practice communication
- GDPR compliance with user consent management and data portability
- CCPA compliance with California privacy rights and data deletion
- Children's privacy protection with COPPA compliance where applicable

DELIVERABLES: (from a broader section, but relevant here)
7. Security and privacy framework with biometric authentication and data protection

```

**Note:** Refer to the full 'Plantopy_execution.txt' document for complete context if needed. Also, consider general platform security aspects if they directly impact mobile security.
