## Task 02: Design and Plan Native Mobile Experiences

**Objective:** Define the native mobile interaction patterns, including gesture-based interactions, haptic feedback, and background intelligence features for the Plantropy mobile app.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on how these native capabilities can enhance the user experience for social and travel planning. Prepare to elaborate on these for development planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
NATIVE MOBILE EXPERIENCES:

**Gesture-Based Interaction:**
- Swipe gestures for rapid plan navigation and comparison
- Pinch-to-zoom for detailed itinerary exploration and map interaction
- Drag-and-drop for intuitive item reordering and categorization
- Long-press for contextual menus and quick actions
- Custom gestures for unique app interactions and branding

**Haptic Feedback System:**
```typescript
// Advanced haptic feedback for enhanced user engagement
class HapticFeedbackController {
  // Contextual haptics for confirmation and error feedback
  triggerHapticFeedback(type: HapticType, intensity: HapticIntensity): void {
    // Action confirmation with subtle tactile acknowledgment
    // Error indication with distinct warning patterns
    // Success celebration with joyful haptic expressions
    // Urgency communication with frequency and intensity modulation
    // Process completion with satisfying closure feedback
    // Attention direction with subtle guidance patterns
  }
}
```

**Background Intelligence:**
```typescript
// Intelligent background processing for seamless user experience
class BackgroundIntelligenceManager {
  // Predictive data prefetching based on user patterns
  async prefetchRelevantData(userContext: UserContext, predictions: UserPredictions): Promise<void> {
    // Anticipatory loading of frequently accessed information
    // Pre-computation of complex data for instant availability
    // Resource optimization with background data refresh scheduling
    // Preference learning with pattern recognition and suggestion refinement
    // Group coordination with proactive conflict detection and resolution preparation
  }
  
  // Intelligent sync with conflict resolution
  async intelligentBackgroundSync(localData: LocalData, remoteData: RemoteData): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // Priority-based sync with critical data processing first
    // Conflict detection with user notification and resolution option preparation
    // Bandwidth optimization with compression and delta synchronization
    // Battery consideration with adaptive sync frequency and intensity
    // Error recovery with retry logic and offline queue management
  }
}
```

**Note:** Refer to the full 'Plantopy_execution.txt' document for complete context if needed.
