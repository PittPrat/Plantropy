## Task 10: Enhance Real-Time Communication System for Mobile

**Objective:** Define the enhancements and considerations for the real-time communication system to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and user experience on the Plantropy mobile platform.

**Instructions:** Review the requirements below from 'Plantopy_execution.txt'. Focus on messaging core, rich media, offline/sync capabilities for messages, notifications, quality assurance for message delivery, and communication security, specifically as they pertain to a mobile environment. Prepare to elaborate on these for development planning.

**Requirements from Plantopy_execution.txt:**

```
REAL-TIME COMMUNICATION SYSTEM:

**Messaging Core:**
- Real-time message delivery with low latency
- Group chat functionality with participant management
- One-on-one private messaging
- Typing indicators and read receipts
- Message history and search functionality

**Rich Media and Interactions:**
- Image, video, and file sharing
- Voice message recording and playback
- Emoji and GIF support with custom sticker packs
- Polls and voting for group decision-making
- Location sharing with map integration

**Offline and Sync Capabilities:**
- Offline message queueing with automatic resend on reconnection
- Intelligent sync for message history across devices
- Conflict resolution for messages sent during network partitions
- Bandwidth optimization for media sharing on mobile
- Battery-efficient background sync for message updates

**Notifications and Alerts:**
- Customizable push notifications for new messages and mentions
- In-app notifications for non-critical updates
- Smart notification grouping to prevent overload
- Snooze and mute options for individual chats or groups
- Critical alert system for urgent coordination needs

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND RELIABILITY (for Communication System):

**Message Delivery Guarantees:**
- At-least-once delivery with deduplication
- Message ordering preservation across all participants
- Delivery confirmation and read receipt tracking
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation for network issues

**Performance Monitoring (for Communication System):**
- Real-time latency tracking and optimization
- Message delivery success rate monitoring
- AI response time and accuracy tracking (if AI is involved in comms)
- User engagement and satisfaction measurement
- Resource usage monitoring for scalability planning

SECURITY AND PRIVACY (for Communication System):

**Communication Security:**
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive group communications
- Secure AI processing with privacy-preserving techniques (if AI is involved)
- Access control for group membership and permissions
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup
- Compliance with privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

DELIVERABLES (relevant part from a broader section):
3. Mobile-optimized communication hub with native integration readiness
